# Terminal Text Editor (Myst Editor)

A terminal based text editor built with C++ and ncurses.
The editor focuses on fast keyboard driven editing, customizable themes, and lightweight performance in terminal environments.

## Overview

Myst is designed for efficient text editing directly in the terminal.
It handles user input, rendering, file operations, and a built-in command runner without relying on external editors, with a focus on responsiveness and control.

It also includes a terminal-style output panel for running system commands inside the editor.

## Core Features

- Keyboard driven editing workflow
- Syntax highlighting for Python and C/C++
- Theme system with configurable color schemes
- Multi file navigation and switching
- Save and Save As functionality
- Configurable user preferences
- Lightweight and fast execution
- Built-in command runner with output panel
- Terminal-style command history stack
- Scrollable command output rendering

## Technical Details

### Input System

- Uses ncurses for raw keyboard and mouse input handling
- Processes key events for navigation, editing commands, and UI panels
- Supports special key handling for arrow keys, escape, and control shortcuts
- Mouse input support used for cursor interaction and UI selection

### Text Buffer

- Manages text using a structured in memory buffer
- Handles insertion, deletion, and navigation efficiently
- Maintains cursor position and viewport state

### Rendering

- Uses ncurses for terminal rendering
- Redraws only necessary regions for performance
- Applies syntax highlighting during render pass
- Supports multiple windows, pads, and panels for UI separation

### Panels and UI System

- Uses ncurses panels for layered UI elements
- Editor, file menu, status bar, and command output are separated into independent views
- Command output is rendered in a dedicated bottom panel

### Built-in Terminal Command System

- Runs system commands using popen
- Captures stdout and stderr output
- Command results are displayed in a scrollable terminal panel
- Supports wrapping long output lines based on screen width

### Syntax Highlighting

- Token based parsing for Python and C/C++
- Identifies keywords, strings, and comments
- Applies color mapping based on theme configuration

### Configuration

- Reads user preferences from configuration files
- Supports theme switching and editor behavior customization
- Applies settings at startup

## Requirements

- C++17 compatible compiler
- ncurses
- xclip
- make
